# AWS Workspace Client

Run aws workspace client on any linux distro supporting docker. Solution humbly taken from [mausch](https://gist.github.com/mausch/168d09d18e354c8e47981b8e44746af9).

Run `make build-image` to build the ubuntu image and install aws workspace client.

Run `make run-aws-workspaces` to run the image and launch the workspaces client.
